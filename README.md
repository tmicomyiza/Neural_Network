# Knapsack problem solver

## AUTHOR:  Mico Micomyiza Theogene


## DESCRIPTION
Artificial Neural Network using Backpropagation algorithm



## PYTHON FILES
ann.py


## REQUIREMENTS

Minimum Python requirements (earlier versions may work but have not been tested):

* Python 3 (3.7.6)
* termcolor module for printing
* numpy


## HOW TO RUN IT

`python3 ann.py`


after running the above command,
you will receive guidance on the use of the program on terminal.

    1. If you want, you can use terminal to insert inputs

    2. Otherwise, the program will randomly generate data to be used


* The program will print final results on the terminal. 

* It will also write information on a file named generations.txt which will
    contain all generations that we created in order to reach the solution
